# **Here a python simple task/todo notation application.**

This project is based on [dStorage](https://pypi.org/project/dStorage/) python library.

it's able to show how  simple is the use of this library.

The library, as a study, the goal of the project is turns more readable the data structure to create data components.


On this project I use dStorage library to provide abstraction on GUI and CLI interfaces for small databases.

The structure is very simple and gives an easy usage.

## USAGE.

**required libraries.**

__tkinter.__

__dStorage.__

__sqlite.__

With this application the output can be choosed to **CLI** and **GUI** with audio output.

The app-config file gives to program important settings, like database and table names and data object structure.

The structure is very simple.

## Some instructions.

dStorage library by default creates SQLite database on home folder.

With app-config you have the right database and table names, also the new aplication name.

## New **changes:**

> The application have a small interface very easy to understand.

> Basicaly you only need make a small notation about the task with a title and small description, I build this application to improve my speed on small notations during tasks with I am doing...

> Maybe this is useful for another people like me with sometimes don't have time to spend or resources to build a detailed anotetions. 

**usage.**

> Go to the program directory and execute NoteByte script.

> If you are on terminal emulator under **GUI** interface the application show a simple GUI interface.

> If you are on _CLI_ interface the application automaticaly detects it and show to you a _text_ mode interface.

## Current.
